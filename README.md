# Task Master Pro

Hey there! Welcome to Task Master Pro - a slick, no-nonsense task management app I built using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. It’s designed to help you keep track of your to-dos with a clean, professional vibe and some handy features to make life easier.

## Features

Here’s what you get with Task Master Pro:

- Add Tasks: Type in your task, hit "Add Task" or press Enter, and it’s on the list.
- Set Deadlines: Pick a date and time for when stuff needs to get done. Overdue tasks turn red so you can’t miss ‘em.
- Priority Levels: Mark tasks as High (red), Normal (blue), or Low (green) to know what’s urgent.
- Complete & Undo: Click "Complete" to check off tasks, or "Undo" if you change your mind.
- Edit Tasks: Tweak task text, deadlines, or priorities whenever you need.
- Delete Tasks: Get rid of tasks you don’t need anymore with a quick click.
- Sort Options: Organize tasks by deadline or priority - your call!
- Clear All: Wipe the slate clean with one button (don’t worry, it asks first).
- Local Storage: Everything saves right in your browser, so your tasks stick around.

Plus, it’s got smooth animations, a responsive design that works on your phone or desktop, and solid error handling so it won’t crash on you.

## How to Get Started

Super easy to set up:

1. Grab the Files: Clone this repo or download the zip.
2. Open It Up: Pop `index.html` into your favorite browser.
3. Start Tasking: That’s it! Add a task and play around with the features.

You’ll need all three files in the same folder:
- `index.html` - The structure
- `styles.css` - The good looks
- `script.js` - The brains

No fancy dependencies or servers required - it’s all client-side and runs off localStorage.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a task app that’s simple but powerful, with a pro look that doesn’t mess around. I threw in deadlines and priorities because who doesn’t need a nudge to focus sometimes? The animations and responsiveness just make it feel nice to use. Plus, I made sure it’s tough enough to handle mistakes without breaking.

## Known Quirks

- If you enter a crazy date in the edit prompt, it might stick with the old one (safety first!).
- Sorting puts tasks without deadlines at the bottom - keeps things tidy.
- It’s all in your browser, so clearing localStorage means bye-bye tasks.

## Future Ideas

If I get around to it, I might add:
- Categories or tags for tasks
- A dark mode toggle
- Export/import tasks
- Notifications for deadlines

Feel free to fork this and make it your own!

## Feedback

Got thoughts? Bugs? Ideas? I’d love to hear ‘em! Open an issue or hit me up if you’re feeling chatty. Hope Task Master Pro helps you get stuff done!

Happy tasking!
